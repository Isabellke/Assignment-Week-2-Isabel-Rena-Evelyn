Once upon a time, there was a chipmunk that wore a red hood. The chipmunk roamed around the grounds and collected acorns for its winter harvest. Suddenly the chipmunk met a big brown bear wearing the same red hood. The bear growled menacingly as the chipmunk wearily moved around the bear. As the bear stomped forward, his shadow loomed over the poor chipmunk. Right as the bear reached out its sharp claws, the chipmunk shut its eyes tightly. The bear suddenly opened its paws and revealed a red fresh berry hidden.
